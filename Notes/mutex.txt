Certainly! In Go, synchronization between goroutines is typically achieved using channels or sync primitives 
like mutexes. Here's a basic example of how you can use a mutex to synchronize access to shared data



SafeCounter is a struct that contains a sync.Mutex and a map count to store integer 
counts associated with string keys.
Inc(key string) method increments the counter for a given key. It uses c.mu.Lock()
 to acquire the lock before modifying the map and c.mu.Unlock() 
to release the lock after modification.
Value(key string) method retrieves the current value of the counter for a given key. It also uses locking 
to ensure safe access to the map.
In main(), we create an instance of SafeCounter and launch 10 goroutines concurrently. 
Each goroutine calls Inc("somekey") 1000 times.
We use time.Sleep(time.Second) to give some time for all goroutines to finish their work before printing
 the final count using counter.Value("somekey").
This ensures that concurrent access to the count map is synchronized using the mutex (c.mu), preventing
race conditions and ensuring safe access to shared data across goroutines.
